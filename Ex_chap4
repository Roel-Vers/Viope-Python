The first exercise in the fourth chapter is a basic while-iteration. The assignment is simple: create a program which on each turn prints the round number. Start by the round number 0 and make the iteration continue for four loops. When the program works correctly, it prints out something like this:



This is lap 0
This is lap 1
This is lap 2
This is lap 3
This is lap 4


The best way to approach this is probably by making two variables. The first one has the current lap number, and the other one marks the point where the iteration is stopped.

solution:
nowround = 0
totalround = 5

while nowround < totalround:
	print ("This is lap ", nowround)
		   
	nowround += 1
  
  
The second exercise tries to elaborates on the first task. The idea is to create an iteration where the user is able to define when the loop ends by testing the input which the user gave.

Create a program which, for every loop, prompts the user for input, and then prints it on the screen. If the user inputs the string "quit", the program prints "Bye bye!" and shuts down. When the program is working correctly it should print out something like this:



>>> 
Write something: What?
What?
Write something: Fight the power.
Fight the power.
Write something: quit
Bye bye!
>>> 


It is probably a good idea to implement the entire program within one "while True" code block, and define the ending criteria so that the program uses a selection criteria and break command.

solution:
userinput = input("Write something: ")
while True:
	if userinput == "quit":
		print("Bye bye!")
		break
	else:
		print(userinput)
		userinput = input("Write something: ")
    
    
 The third progam tests a for-iteration. In this program, build a calculator, which asks the user for a number, and calculates the sum of all positive numbers from 0 to the usergiven input. If the user gives the number 4, the program calculates the sum 0+1+2+3, if 7, the calculation is 0+1+2+3+4+5+6. Finally, the program produces an answer with the printout "The sum was:" and an answer.

When working correctly, the program prints something like this:



>>> 
Give a number: 3
The sum was: 3
>>> 

Give a number: 5
The sum was: 10
>>> 




Keep in mind, that with the for in range-approach, there is always a variable which knows the current round number. Also, in this exercise it is allowed to assume that the user does not give faulty inputs such as letters or empty lines.

solution:
n = int(input("Give a number: "))
sum = 0
for num in range(0,n):
    sum = sum+num
print("The sum was: ", sum )


The last exercise in this chapter continues with the exercise from the last chapter, the calculator. In this exercise, expand the existing code by implementing the following new features: (A) Calculator does not automatically quit when the result is given, allowing user to do new calculations. The user has to select "6" in the menu to exit the program. (B) The calculator shows the selected numbers in the main menu by printing "Current numbers:" and the user-given input. By selecting "5" in the calculator menu, the user can change the given numbers. When implemented correctly, the program prints out following:



Calculator
Give the first number: 100
Give the second number: 25
(1) +
(2) -
(3) *
(4) /
(5) Change numbers
(6) Quit
Current numbers: 100 25
Please select something (1-6): 5
Give the first number: 10
Give the second number: 30

(1) +
(2) -
(3) *
(4) /
(5) Change numbers
(6) Quit
Current numbers: 10 30
Please select something (1-6): 1
The result is: 40

(1) +
(2) -
(3) *
(4) /
(5) Change numbers
(6) Quit
Current numbers: 10 30
Please select something (1-6): 6
Thank you!
>>> 


Again, implement the program within one large while True-segment, which is terminated with break if the user selects the option "6". 

solution:
print("Calculator")
number1 = input("Give the first number: ")
number1 = int(number1)
number2 = input("Give the second number: ")
number2 = int(number2)

print("(1) +")
print("(2) -")
print("(3) *")
print("(4) /")
print("(5) Change numbers")
print("(6) Quit")
print("Current numbers: ", number1, " ", number2)
select = input("Please select something (1-6): ")

while True:
	if select == "6":
		print("Thank you!")
		break
	else:
		if select == "1":
			result = number1+number2
			result = str(result)
			print("The result is: " + result)
		elif select == "2":
			result = number1-number2
			result = str(result)
			print("The result is: " + result)
		elif select == "3":
			result = number1*number2
			result = str(result)
			print("The result is: " + result)
		elif select == "4":
			result = number1/number2
			result = str(result)
			print("The result is: " + result)
		elif select == "5":
			number1 = input("Give the first number: ")
			number1 = int(number1)
			number2 = input("Give the second number: ")
			number2 = int(number2)
		print("(1) +")
		print("(2) -")
		print("(3) *")
		print("(4) /")
		print("(5) Change numbers")
		print("(6) Quit")
		print("Current numbers: ", number1, " ", number2)
		select = input("Please select something (1-6): ")
