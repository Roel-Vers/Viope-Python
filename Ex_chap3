The exercises of the third chapter, as well as the third chapter itself, focus on the conditional if-structure. In the first exercise the objective is to create a simple if-structure. The program should first ask a number from the user and save it to a variable. Then if the number is even (possible to divide by 2), the program should print the text "The given number was even.". The best way to do this is to use the operator remainder. The program should print the following:



Give a number: 24
The given number was even.


or alternatively



Give a number: 11


Meaning that the program should not print anything if the number is odd.

solution:
value = input("Give a number: ")
value = int(value)

if value % 2 == 0:
	print("The given number was even.")
  
  
The second exercise takes another step towards more realistic programming structures. In this exercise the idea is to create an if-structure, which has another if-structure inside it. Basically the idea is to implement the following structure:



if [selection]:
	[code]
	
	if [selection]:
		[code]
	else:
		[code}
else:
	[code]


The idea is to create a program which asks for a user name and password. If the given name is wrong, the program prints "The given name is wrong". If the name is acceptable, the program asks for the password. If the password is correct, the system prints "Both inputs are correct!", otherwise "The password is incorrect.". The correct inputs should be "John" and the password "ABC123". Overall, the program should print the following:



Give name: Peter
The given name is wrong.


or alternatively



Give name: John
Give password: Monkeys?
The password is incorrect.


or alternatively




Give name: John
Give password: ABC123
Both inputs are correct!

solution:
name = "John"
password = "ABC123"

askedname = input("Give name: ")

if askedname == name:
	askedpass = input("Give password: ")
	
	if askedpass == password:
		print("Both inputs are correct!")
	else: 
		print("The password is incorrect.")

else: 
	print("The given name is wrong.")
  
  
The third exercise is to create a conditional structure which prints a line depending on the given selection. The program asks a number between 1 and 3, and based on the number prints the following: 1 prints "You selected one.", 2 prints "You selected two." and 3 prints "You selected three.", like this:



Select a number (1-3): 1
You selected one.

solution:
number = input("Select a number (1-3): ")

if number == "1":
	print("You selected one.")
elif number == "2":
	print("You selected two.")
else:
	print("You selected three.")
	
 
In the fourth exercise the idea is to define an if-structure which decides the action based on several inputs. The program asks for two numbers. If both of the numbers are even, the program prints "Both numbers are even." If only one of the numbers is even, the program prints "One of the numbers is even.". Finally, if neither of the numbers is even, the program prints "Both numbers are odd". When correct, the program works as following:



Give a number: 10
Give another number: 11
One of the numbers is even.


or alternatively



Give a number: 12
Give another number: 20
Both numbers are even.


or alternatively



Give a number: 15
Give another number: 21
Both numbers are odd.

solution:
number1 = input("Give a number: ")
number1 = int(number1)
number2 = input("Give another number: ")
number2 = int(number2)

if number1%2==0 and number2%2==0:
	print("Both numbers are even.")
elif number1%2!=0 and number2%2!=0:
	print("Both numbers are odd.")
else:
	print("One of the numbers is even.")
  
  
The last exercise of chapter 5 continues the exercise made in the previous chapter. In this exercise, expand the calculator so that the user can select what kind of calculation is done. If the user chooses 1, the calculator does addition as earlier. If 2, the calculator does substraction, if 3, it does multiplication, if 4, division.

Also add the instructions for the user to know what to do as shown in the example below. Also, if the user selects anything else besides 1-4, the program prints "Selection was not correct.". When working correctly, the progam looks like the following:



Calculator
Give the first number: 100
Give the second number: 25
(1) +
(2) -
(3) *
(4) /
Please select something (1-4): 3
The result is: 2500


If the user selects something else besides 1-4, it prints the following:



Calculator
Give the first number: 320
Give the second number: 225
(1) +
(2) -
(3) *
(4) /
Please select something (1-4): 100
Selection was not correct.



Errors such as the user giving input which is not a number, or division by 0, can be ignored at this point.

solution:
print("Calculator")
number1 = input("Give the first number: ")
number1 = int(number1)
number2 = input("Give the second number: ")
number2 = int(number2)

print("(1) +")
print("(2) -")
print("(3) *")
print("(4) /")

select = input("Please select something (1-4): ")

if select == "1":
	result = number1+number2
	result = str(result)
	print("The result is: " + result)
elif select == "2":
	result = number1-number2
	result = str(result)
	print("The result is: " + result)
elif select == "3":
	result = number1*number2
	result = str(result)
	print("The result is: " + result)
elif select == "4":
	result = number1/number2
	result = str(result)
	print("The result is: " + result)
else:
	print("Selection was not correct.")
